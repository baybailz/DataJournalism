          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Income and Healthcare</h2>
          <p>The first notable correlation is the positive correlation between higher poverty rate and higher percentages lacking 
            healthcare. 
          </p>

          <p>The second, and perhaps the most interesting correlation, appears to show that southern states are over represented between the 16-20% poverty rates. Are poverty rates and higher percentages of the population 
            in southern states more correlated than in Northern States? It appears that the graph could suggest that. It would be interesting to see if population has any effect on this correlation. 
          </p>

          <p>Lastly, the final discovery in the graph is the comparison between Texas and North Carolina. While both have nearly the same poverty rate, 
            Texas has a higher percentage of the population lacking healthcare, this could suggest that the question of whether or not population differences have an effect on
            correlations in this graph could be true and should be studied further.</p>
